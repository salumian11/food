        <h2 class="text-dark">Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a commercial term,
             limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out/take-away.
              Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers.
               In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.[1]
            The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds.
             Other fast food outlets, primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
              pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.)
               and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".

      <h2 class="text-dark"> The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with urban developments.
        Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate space or proper food preparation accoutrements. Additionally, procuring cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive. Homeowners feared that a rogue cooking fire "might easily conflagrate an entire neighborhood".
        [12] Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever possible. This also ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting 
        for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant).
